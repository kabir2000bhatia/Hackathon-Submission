Greetings To GSBSP Team,

First of all i would like to thank GSBSP Team for organizing such a wonderful Hackathon . It was a great experience for me as i got a chance to improve my 
frontend development skills. I thoroughly enjoyed the sessions taken by your team.

In the last 12 hours i worked on debugging my website and checking for any unresolved errors and to be honest there were a quite a number of them. So it is always
good to debug your website before deploying it.

I also tested my website against different devices in order to check the site's responsiveness and how it is performing on different screen sizes. According to those tests ,
i ensured that my website is completely responsive on all the viewports(from mobile devices to dekstop screen).

Finally, i created the repository as per the instructions given by GSBSP team and hosted my website on it.

Thanking GirlScriptBilaspur for organizing this Hackathon and hoping to participate and collaborate in future events as well.

Kabir Bhatia(Btech Student SRM IST)
